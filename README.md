# Lip-Syncing Audio to Video

## Overview

This repository contains a pipeline for accurately lip-syncing provided audio files to a given video, achieving high-quality synchronization. The implementation uses the Wav2Lip model to synchronize audio with video.

## Features

- Lip-syncs audio to video with high accuracy.
- Utilizes the Wav2Lip model for synchronization.
- Supports multiple audio files.
- Generates output videos with synchronized audio.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional but recommended for faster processing)
- FFmpeg

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip.git
    cd lip-syncing
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the Wav2Lip pre-trained model checkpoint and place it in the `checkpoints/` directory. You can download the model from [Wav2Lip Repository](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip).

4. Install FFmpeg:

    - For Ubuntu:

        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install ffmpeg
        ```

    - For Windows/Mac, follow the instructions on the [FFmpeg official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## Usage

1. Prepare your video and audio files. Place them in the `Resources/Video/` and `Resources/Audio/` directories, respectively.

2. Run the lip-syncing script:

    ```bash
    python inference.py --checkpoint_path checkpoints/wav2lip_gan.pth --face Resources/Video/13_K.mp4 --audio Resources/Audio/10_S.wav --outfile output/13_K_10_S_synced.mp4
    ```

    Repeat the above command for each audio file you want to sync with the video, changing the `--audio` and `--outfile` arguments accordingly.



## Results

The generated video files with synchronized audio will be saved in the `results/` directory. Each file will have a name indicating the input video and audio used.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the lip-sync accuracy by visually inspecting the generated videos or using automatic lip-sync evaluation metrics if available. Adjust the model parameters or preprocessing steps if necessary to improve synchronization.

## Fine-Tuning

To improve synchronization accuracy, consider fine-tuning the model with additional training data or adjusting preprocessing steps. This could involve:

- Collecting more training data specific to your use case.
- Experimenting with different model architectures or hyperparameters.
- Improving audio and video preprocessing techniques.
